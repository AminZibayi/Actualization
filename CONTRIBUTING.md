## How to contribute

- Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your changes.
- Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of your change.
- Run tests and linters locally before submitting.

## Local development

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Run the dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Run tests: `pnpm test`

## Coding guidelines

- Follow the existing TypeScript and React patterns used in the repo.
- Keep changes small and focused; add tests for new behavior.

## TODO

- [ ] Add localStorage persistence for canvas state — persist the canvas data (blocks, positions, selections, etc.) to `localStorage` so that user sessions survive page refreshes and accidental navigations.

If you'd like help implementing the TODOs above, open an issue or a draft PR and include a short design note describing your approach.
